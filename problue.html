    <h2> What is PROBLUE?</h2>
    <p>
      

PROBLUE is a new Umbrella Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), housed at the World Bank, that supports healthy and productive oceans. PROBLUE supports implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) and is fully aligned with the World Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing the income and welfare of the poor in a sustainable way. PROBLUE is part of the World Bank’s overall Blue Economy program, which takes a multi-pronged, coordinated approach to ensuring the protection and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources.

    <h2>How does PROBLUE fit into the World Bank’s overall work on oceans?</h2>
    <p>
  PROBLUE is fully aligned with the Blue Economy work program at the Bank. The term Blue Economy refers to the development of oceanic economic activities in an integrated and sustainable way. It is focused on capturing potential synergies and managing the trade-offs across industries to better address the growing threats now confronting oceans, and particularly those posed by climate change.  A Blue Economy strives to maximize the socio-economic benefits generated by oceanic activities, including food production and job creation.

    <h2>Why is the Blue Economy concept important for sustainable development and economic growth?</h2>
    <p>
     Oceans protect biodiversity, provide jobs, food, drive economic growth, keep the planet cool, and absorbs about 30% of global CO2 emissions.  At least 3-5% of global GDP is derived from oceans—but their overall health is reaching a tipping point. Close to a third of fish stocks are overfished, climate change affects coastal and marine ecosystems, unbridled development in the coastal zone is causing erosion, and marine pollution—particularly from land-based sources—is reaching such a proportion that its impact cannot be accurately measured. Business as usual will have great negative environmental and social impacts, which are expected to disproportionally affect vulnerable groups of the population, particularly women and girls. This is reflected in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 14), which calls to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.
