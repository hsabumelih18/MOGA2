    <h2>Fisheries and Aquaculture</h2>
    <p>
        Improving fisheries by tackling the underlying causes of overfishing and strengthening aquaculture sustainability

The overall objective of Pillar 1 is to improve fisheries governance. Activities are divided into two broad categories:

1.Reducing overexploitation of capture fisheries, including by improving transparency, governance, and reducing the impact of harmful fisheries subsidies; 
2.Improving aquaculture, including by increasing biosecurity to prevent disease, and supporting new development models in aquaculture

    <h2>Marine Pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Addressing threats posed to ocean health from marine pollution, including litter and plastics, from marine or land-based sources

The overall objective of Pillar 2 is the prevention of marine pollution and litter. This requires new policies, changes from consumers and industries, investments, innovations, and private sector interventions. Pillar 2 is prioritizing activities that prevent marine plastics, including:

Improving solid waste management to stop leakages;

Transitioning to a more circular economy, in which products are designed for reuse and recycling, making waste more valuable;

Reducing the upstream production and use of plastics

    <h2>Oceanic Sectors</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing sustainability of key oceanic sectors such as tourism, maritime transport and offshore renewable energy

The overall objective of Pillar 3 is the “blueing” of oceanic sectors, to be achieved by supporting more sustainable development of both:

Traditional maritime activities: e.g. shipping and ports, and tourism.

More innovative uses: e.g. offshore wind and desalination.
